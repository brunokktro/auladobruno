### Dicas de estudo para as certificações

- [X] Escolha sua [carreira de certificações](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) e organize o seu [roteiro de aprendizado](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learning-paths/)
- [X] Revise o arquivo [_Exam Guide_](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/) do respectivo exame de certificação
- [X] Defina uma estratégia eficiente de estudos. Há algumas técnicas bem interessantes como o [_Retrieval_](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/using-retrieval-practice-techniques-to-improve-learning/), [_Spaced_](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/use-spaced-practice-to-increase-learning-retention/) e o [_Elaboration_](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/cognitive-science-post-3-using-elaboration-to-reinforce-your-understanding-of-concepts/)
- [X] Faça um treinamento oficial, presencial ou remoto, ministrado pela AWS. Veja mais em [aws.training](https://www.aws.training/)
- [X] Caso vá fazer o treinamento oficial, já prepare seu ambiente para materiais e labs no [Class Prep](https://classprep.awstc.com/)
- [X] Organize um roteiro sequencial de estudos, usando os [_Ramp-Up Guides_](https://aws.amazon.com/training/ramp-up-guides/)
- [X] Faça laboratórios e ganhe experiência prática, com os [Tutoriais de Hands-On](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/)
- [X] Revise o arquivo de **_Sample Questions_** do respectivo exame de certificação
- [X] Revise os _whitepapers_ e **FAQs** dos serviços que estão no escopo do exame de certificação
- [X] Assista os vídeos da série [_"This is My Architecture"_](https://aws.amazon.com/this-is-my-architecture/), com exemplos de casos reais dos clientes AWS
- [X] Faça um treinamento oficial da AWS com foco na preparação do exame; através dos cursos **_Exam Readiness_**
- [X] Acompanhe [nossos eventos e webinars da comunidade AWS em LATAM](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/training/events), pois sempre há conteúdo de referência para ajudar nos estudos
- [X] Faça um [**_Practice Exam_**](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/9153/aws-certification-official-practice-question-sets-english) oficial (simulado)
- [X] Agende seu [exame de certificação](https://www.aws.training/Certification) na **Person Vue**, e depois teste como é a dinâmica do exame em [AWS Exam Demo](https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/redirects/aws/demo-test-enu.html)
- [X] Adicione [30 minutos a mais](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-minute-extension-your-aws-certification-exam-garcia-lozano/) em seu exame com o **_ESL +30 MINUTES_** (disponível para não-nativos de língua inglesa) 
- [X] Seja um certificado AWS!
- [X] Aproveite os [benefícios](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/benefits/) concedidos só a quem tem certificações AWS
